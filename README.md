# CounterApp

A simple counter application built with **React** that demonstrates basic concepts of event handling and state management. CounterApp includes **+ and - buttons** to dynamically increment or decrement a displayed value on the UI. This project was styled using **Tailwind CSS** and provides a foundation for learning and practicing React fundamentals.

## Features

- **Dynamic Counter**: Increases or decreases the displayed value based on user input
- **Event Handling**: Updates state based on button clicks
- **State Management**: Utilizes the `useState` hook for state changes
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Provides a minimal and clean UI design

## Project Structure

All logic is implemented within `App.js` to keep the project simple and focused on core React functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
